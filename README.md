# Long Name UI Card Experiment

A few days ago, I came across a post discussing how long names can sometimes break the UI layout on small screens on LinkedIn. Out of curiosity, I decided to recreate it and experiment with different name lengths.

This is a small example card with an input field to test how names of various lengths appear in the design. While it took longer than expected, it was a fun and insightful exploration into responsive UI and layout handling.
